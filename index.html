        <p id="footer-text">I know things between us aren't going well, and there are a lot of problems that have come up, but honestly, <br>I haven't done anything to create them. Maybe my messages or showing attention to you didn't feel right to you, and that's why you asked me not to message you. <br>So, I stopped because I didn't want to disturb you. I know there are a lot of boundaries between us, and I want to respect them. <br>I just wanted to say sorry if anything I did upset you or if anything I said wasn't right. Please forgive me if that happened. I just want us to be good friends! And I hope you liked this surprise. <br>Happy birthday, Damni!
        <br> Always remember, I'm here cheering you on, believing in you every step of the way. <br>You're capable of achieving greatness, and I'm so proud to be by your side as you chase your dreams. <br><br> Designed by Satyam Raj</p>
